Basic stuff for Python programming


# Key concepts for undertanding (and using) Python

## python 2 vs 3
Python 2.7 has been the widely used version for a while. 
Now, it's safe to use Python 3 (3.5 or 3.6).

In our lab servers, both python 2 and 3 are installed.
You can (should) run python 3 by typing python3.
```
python3
```

You can check the version of the python as follows.
```
python --version
```
On Ubuntu 16.04.3, it will be Python 2.7.12.
```
python3 --version
```
On Ubuntu 16.04.3, it will be Python 3.5.2.





## virtual environment 
In pythone 3 (from 3.3), venv is the standard way for creating and using virtual environments.

See here https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html.


## pip
You can use 'pip' to install python modules.

See here https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html?highlight=pip.



## Jupyter notebook
